## Blockchain-based Data Security Solution for B2B Interactions
### A comprehensive system for tracking and protecting companies' sensitive data on the web, specifically when the data is input into AIaaS.
   
   
### The Problem:
##### Many businesses send their sensitive data to other businesses for data analysis and processing.For example, companies upload their office security camera streams on security service providers’ servers for face recognition, harassment detection, etc. 
##### Although companies who handle sensitive data of other businesses claim they protect their customers’ data integrity at highest standards, there is an immense amount of concern about misuse of data by companies which provide analytic and intelligent services.
   
### Our Solution:
##### To overcome this challenge, we have created a Blockchain-based solution to keep an immutable trusted track of the data that a service-customer company sends over to a service-provider company. Our software reports how the data is exercised by the service-provider, and if enabled to, it will automatically prohibit bad-natured requests of the service-provider.
